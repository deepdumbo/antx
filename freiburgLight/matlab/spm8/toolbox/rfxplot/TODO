TODO list for rfxplot
* export data into a struct array that can be reused in different runs
* implement an across-subject correlation between BOLD and a external
  variable in a non-Voodoo way
* include an additional adjustment option that removes the effect of
  all other regressor, except those that belong to the current event
  type (e.g. the current onset regressor and all associated pmods)
* PSC for time courses
* implement PSTH like in SPM as an additional option (not just
  event-related averaging)
* extract data from PPI analysis. Regressors are stored in SPM.xX.C
  partition
